Dataset; https://www.kaggle.com/anupamshah/perrin-freres-monthly-champagne-sales

#### Problem Description
Predict the number of monthly sales of champagne for the Perrin Freres label (named for a region in France).
The dataset provides the number of monthly sales of champagne from January 1964 to September 1972, or just under 10 years of data.
The values are a count of millions of sales and there are 105 observations.

The main files are <b><a href="https://github.com/mulongocheloti/Champagne-Sales-Forecast/blob/main/salesPredict.ipynb">.ipynb file</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/anupamshah/perrin-freres-monthly-champagne-sales">the dataset</a></b><br>

<b>Project:</b> Using time series forecasting we are going to learn from the sales trend between <b>January 1964 and September 1972</b> and use that information to predict the sales between <b>October 1972 and August 1974.</b><br>
<br>
Finally we will have a line chart showing the sales trend together with the sales forecast as shown below;<br>
